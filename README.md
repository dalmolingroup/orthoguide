Welcome to the OrthoGuide project! This repository contains the backend API and frontend application for OrthoGuide, a web tool for evolutionary rooting analysis based on [GeneBridge](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msae019) results.

# Repository Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `orthoguide_api/`: Contains the backend API built with FastAPI. It serves rooting data from a pre-processed database. This directory also includes tests written with pytest.

- `orthoguide_front/`: Contains the frontend single-page applicaiton built with Vue.js.
